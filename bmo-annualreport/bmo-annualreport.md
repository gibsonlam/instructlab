About BMO
Our Purpose: Boldly Grow the Good in business and life
BMO has a deep sense of purpose – to be a champion of progress and a catalyst for change. We are leveraging our position as a leading financial services provider in order to create opportunities for our communities and our stakeholders to make positive, sustainable change – because we believe that success can and must be mutual. Our bold commitments for a thriving economy, a sustainable future and an inclusive society are reflected in our active, direct response to today’s most pressing challenges:
• Thriving economy – Providing access to capital and valuable financial advice – investing in businesses, supporting home ownership and
strengthening the communities we serve, while driving innovation that makes banking easier.
• Sustainable future – Being our clients’ lead partner in the transition to a net zero world, delivering on our commitments to sustainable
financing and responsible investing.
• Inclusive society – Committing to zero barriers to inclusion through investments, financial products and services, and partnerships that remove systemic barriers for under-represented customers, employees and communities – and drive inclusion and equitable growth for everyone.

Our Strategic Priorities 
The strength and consistency of our performance are essential to realizing our Purpose. We aim to deliver top-tier total shareholder return and achieve our financial objectives by aligning our operations with, and executing on, our strategic priorities. Keeping the fundamentals of our strategy consistent, we renewed our priorities for fiscal 2024 to reflect our strong momentum in an environment of ongoing transformation:
• World-class loyalty and growth, powered by One Client leadership, bringing the full suite of BMO’s products, services and advice to our clients
• Winning culture driven by alignment, empowerment and recognition
• Digital First for speed, scale and the elimination of complexity
• Be our clients’ lead partner in the transition to a net zero world 
• Superior management of risk, capital and funding performance
Our group strategic priorities align with and support our enterprise-wide strategy, positioning us well to achieve competitive performance.
The operating group strategies are outlined in the 2023 Operating Groups Performance Review.

Our Approach to Sustainability 
Our commitment to sustainability is embedded in our strategy and is fundamental to our Purpose. We identify the most significant effects of our business operations, products and services on our stakeholders and the communities in which we operate. We take steps to manage our business in a manner that is consistent with our sustainability objectives, while also considering the interests of our stakeholders. We apply a variety of environmental, social and governance (ESG) practices and benchmarks to capture opportunities and manage risks in key areas such as sustainable finance, climate change, human rights, and diversity, equity and inclusion.

Our Values 
Four core values shape our culture and underpin our choices and actions:
• Integrity 
• Diversity 
• Responsibility 
• Empathy 

Earnings per Share Growth 
All references to earnings per share (EPS) are to diluted EPS, unless otherwise indicated. 
EPS was $5.68 in 2023, a decrease of $14.31 or 72% from $19.99 in 2022. Adjusted EPS was $11.73, a decrease of $1.50 or 11% from $13.23 in 2022. The decrease in EPS reflected lower earnings and a higher number of common shares outstanding. Net income available to common shareholders decreased 70% year-over-year on a reported basis, and decreased 5% on an adjusted basis. The average number of diluted common shares outstanding increased 7% from 2022, reflecting common shares issued during the year through a public offering, private placements, the dividend reinvestment plan, acquisitions and the stock option plan.

Return on Equity and Return on Tangible Common Equity 
Reported return on equity (ROE) was 6.0% in 2023 and adjusted ROE was 12.3%, compared with 22.9% and 15.2%, respectively, in 2022. Reported ROE decreased due to lower net income, primarily due to lower revenue in the current year resulting from the impact of fair value management actions related to the acquisition of Bank of the West, and higher expenses in the current year due to higher acquisition and integration-related costs. Reported and adjusted ROE decreased due to the impact of share issuances, as well as lower earnings.
There was a decrease of $9,272 million in reported net income available to common shareholders and a decrease of $476 million in adjusted net income available to common shareholders in the current year. Average common shareholders’ equity increased $9.4 billion or 16% from 2022, primarily due to the issuance of common shares and growth in retained earnings, partially offset by a decrease in accumulated other comprehensive income.
Reported return on tangible common equity (ROTCE) was 8.2%, compared with 25.1% in 2022, and adjusted ROTCE was 15.8%, compared with 16.6% in 2022. Reported and adjusted ROTCE decreased due to lower earnings, partially offset by lower tangible common equity. Book value per share increased 2% from the prior year to $97.17, reflecting the increase in shareholders’ equity.

Efficiency Ratio and Operating Leverage 
BMO’s reported gross efficiency ratio was 68.0% in 2023, compared with 48.0% in 2022. On a net revenue basis (1), the reported efficiency ratio was 72.5%, compared with 47.1% in 2022, and the adjusted efficiency ratio was 59.8%, compared with 55.8% in 2022. The increase in the efficiency ratio reflected revenue growth that was more than offset by higher expense growth, as well as the impact of Bank of the West, which operated at a higher efficiency ratio.
Reported operating leverage was negative 38.5%. On a net revenue basis, reported operating leverage was negative 45.9%, and adjusted operating leverage was negative 8.2%.

Common Equity Tier 1 Ratio 
Our Common Equity Tier 1 (CET1) Ratio was 12.5% as at October 31, 2023, compared with 16.7% as at October 31, 2022. Our CET1 Ratio was elevated at the end of fiscal 2022, primarily driven by fair value management actions related to the acquisition of Bank of the West. The CET1 Ratio decreased from the prior year, primarily as a result of the acquisition and integration of Bank of the West.

Total Shareholder Return 
For the year ended October 31 2023 
Closing market price per common share ($) 104.79 
Dividends paid ($ per share) 5.72 
Dividend yield (%) 5.5 
Increase (decrease) in share price (%) (16.5) 
Total annual shareholder return (%) (12.5) 
Canadian peer group average (excluding BMO) (8.8)

The average annual total shareholder return (TSR) is a key measure of shareholder value, and over time, we expect that execution on our strategic priorities will drive value creation for our shareholders. The one-year, three-year and five-year average annual TSR was negative 12.5%, positive 14.3% and positive 5.6%, respectively, compared with our Canadian peer group average (excluding BMO) of negative 8.8%, positive 10.0% and positive 5.5%, respectively.
The table above summarizes dividends paid on BMO’s common shares over the past five years and the movements in our share price. An investment of $1,000 in BMO common shares made at the beginning of fiscal 2019 would have been worth $1,315 as at October 31, 2023, assuming reinvestment of dividends, for a total return of 31.5%.
Dividends declared per common share in fiscal 2023 totalled $5.80, an increase of $0.36 from $5.44 in the prior year. Dividends paid over a five-year period have increased at an average annual compound rate of approximately 9%.

Supporting a Sustainable and Inclusive Future
In support of our customers, communities and employees, in 2023 we:

• Continued to drive progress for mental health treatment with a $5 million donation to the Centre for Addiction and Mental Health (CAMH) to support independent research at its Krembil Centre for Neuroinformatics and help build a research centre.

• Released Wîcihitowin, our third annual Indigenous Partnerships and Progress Report, highlighting our focus on advancing education, employment and economic empowerment in First Nations, Inuit and Métis communities. In addition, we announced six new members of our Indigenous Advisory Council (IAC), which now includes leaders from across Canada. BMO’s leadership continues to be recognized in a significant number of rankings, including:

• Included for the third consecutive year in the 2023 Women Lead Here list published by the Globe and Mail in its Report on Business magazine to recognize Canadian businesses for excellence in gender diversity in executive roles.

Recent Acquisitions
On February 1, 2023, we completed our acquisition of Bank of the West, including its subsidiaries, from BNP Paribas. Bank of the West provides a broad range of banking products and services, primarily in the Western and Midwestern regions of the United States. The acquisition strengthens our position in North America with increased scale and greater access to growth opportunities in strategic new markets. We completed the conversion of Bank of the West customer accounts and systems to our respective BMO operating platforms in September 2023. The acquisition has been reflected in our results as a business combination, primarily in the U.S. P&C and BMO Wealth Management reporting segments.
On closing, we recognized purchase accounting fair value marks on Bank of the West’s loans and deposits of $3.0 billion and discounts on securities of $3.5 billion on our balance sheet, in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS). As previously disclosed, to manage the exposure of our regulatory capital to the risk of changes in the fair value of the assets and liabilities of Bank of the West due to changes in interest rates between the announcement and closing of the acquisition, we entered into interest rate swaps that resulted in cumulative mark-to-market gains of $5.7 billion on closing. Any exposure to interest rate risk in relation to these interest rate swaps was largely offset by our purchase of a portfolio of matched-duration U.S. treasuries and other balance sheet instruments. On closing, the swaps were neutralized and replaced with fair value accounting hedges, which in effect crystallized the unrealized loss position on our balance sheet. Accretion of the fair value marks and the discount on securities will increase net interest income, and the amortization of the fair value hedge will decrease net interest income over the remaining term of these instruments, both of which will be recorded in Corporate Services.
On June 1, 2023, we completed the acquisition of the AIR MILES Reward Program (AIR MILES) business of LoyaltyOne Co. The AIR MILES business operates as a wholly-owned subsidiary of BMO. The acquisition was accounted for as a business combination and the acquired business and corresponding goodwill are included in our Canadian P&C reporting segment

2023 Financial Performance Review
This section provides a review of BMO’s enterprise financial performance for 2023 that ocuses on the Consolidated Statement of Income in BMO’s audited annual consolidated financial statements. A review of the operating groups’ strategies and performance follows the enterprise review.
We use a number of financial measures to assess our performance, as well as the performance of our operating segments, including amounts, measures and ratios that are presented on a non-GAAP basis. We believe that these non-GAAP amounts, measures and ratios, read together with our GAAP results, provide readers with a better understanding of how management assesses results.
Non-GAAP amounts, measures and ratios do not have standardized meanings under GAAP. They are unlikely to be comparable to similar measures presented by other companies and should not be viewed in isolation from, or as a substitute for, GAAP results.
Further discussion of non-GAAP amounts, measures and ratios is provided in the Non-GAAP and Other Financial Measures section.
For further information regarding the composition of non-GAAP and other financial measures, including supplementary financial measures, refer to the Glossary of Financial Terms.

The table above indicates the relevant average Canadian/U.S. dollar exchange rates and the impact of changes in those rates on BMO’s U.S. segment reported and adjusted results.
The Canadian dollar equivalents of BMO’s U.S. segment results that are denominated in U.S. dollars increased in 2023 relative to 2022, due to changes in the Canadian/U.S. dollar exchange rate. References in this document to the impact of the U.S. dollar do not include U.S. dollar-denominated amounts recorded outside of BMO’s U.S. segment.
Economically, our U.S. dollar income stream was not hedged against the risk of changes in foreign exchange rates during 2023 and 2022. Changes in exchange rates will affect future results measured in Canadian dollars, and the impact on those results is a function of the periods in which revenue, expenses and provisions for (or recoveries of) credit losses and income taxes arise.
Refer to the Enterprise-Wide Capital Management section for a discussion of the impact that changes in foreign exchange rates can have on BMO’s capital position

Net Income 
Reported net income was $4,377 million, compared with $13,537 million in the prior year, and adjusted net income was $8,675 million, a decrease of $364 million or 4%. The inclusion of Bank of the West results in the current year decreased reported net income by $1,498 million, and increased adjusted net income by $592 million. The impact of the stronger U.S. dollar increased net income by 1% on a reported basis, and 2% on an adjusted basis.
Adjusted results in the current year and the prior year excluded the following items:

Reported net income decreased from the prior year, primarily due to the items noted above, which in aggregate reduced net income by $4,298 million, compared with a gain of $4,498 million in the prior year. Adjusted net income decreased, as the inclusion of Bank of the West and higher underlying revenue were more than offset by higher expenses and a higher provision for credit losses. Reported and adjusted net income increased in U.S. P&C and decreased in BMO Wealth Management, Canadian P&C and BMO Capital Markets. On a reported basis, Corporate Services recorded a net loss, compared with net income in the prior year, primarily due to the items noted above. On an adjusted basis, Corporate Services recorded a higher net loss.

Revenue, net of CCPB, and adjusted results are on a non-GAAP basis and are discussed in the Non-GAAP and Other Financial Measures section.
Reported revenue was $31,199 million, a decrease of $2,511 million or 7% from the prior year. On a basis that nets insurance claims, commissions and changes in policy benefit liabilities (CCPB) against insurance revenue (net revenue), reported net revenue was $29,260 million, a decrease of $5,133 million or 15% from the prior year, and adjusted net revenue was $31,439 million, an increase of $4,223 million or 16%. The inclusion of Bank of the West contributed $3,143 million to both reported and adjusted revenue in the current year. The impact of the stronger U.S. dollar increased revenue by 2% on both a reported and an adjusted basis.
The decrease in reported net revenue primarily reflected the impact of fair value management actions and the impact of certain tax measures enacted by the Canadian government, partially offset by lower interest expense due to the legal provision related to the lawsuit associated with M&I Marshall and Ilsley Bank in the prior year. Net revenue increased across all operating groups and decreased in Corporate Services on both a reported and an adjusted basis.
BMO analyzes revenue at the consolidated level based on GAAP revenue as reported in the audited annual consolidated financial statements, on a basis net of insurance CCPB, and on an adjusted basis.

Net Interest Income 
Reported net interest income was $18,681 million, an increase of $2,796 million or 18% from the prior year, and adjusted net interest income was $19,094 million, an increase of $2,742 million or 17%.
The increase in reported net interest income primarily reflected lower interest expense related to the lawsuit associated with M&I Marshall and Ilsley Bank in the prior year, partially offset by the impact of fair value management actions in the current year.
Adjusted net interest income increased due to the inclusion of Bank of the West, higher balances and margins in Canadian P&C and higher margins in U.S. P&C, as well as the impact of the stronger U.S. dollar, partially offset by a decrease in trading-related interest income, lower net interest income in Corporate Services and the impact of risk transfer transactions. Trading-related net interest income was $900 million, a decrease of $772 million, and was largely offset in trading non-interest revenue.
BMO’s overall reported net interest margin of 1.63% increased 1 basis point from the prior year. Adjusted net interest margin, excluding trading-related net interest income and trading-related earning assets, was 1.86%, an increase of 8 basis points, primarily due to higher margins in our P&C businesses, including the impact of Bank of the West, partially offset by higher low-yielding assets and lower net interest income in Corporate Services.

Reported non-interest revenue was $12,518 million, a decrease of $5,307 million from the prior year. Reported non-interest revenue, net of CCPB, was $10,579 million, a decrease of $7,929 million or 43% from the prior year, and adjusted non-interest revenue, net of CCPB, was $12,345 million, an increase of $1,481 million or 14%. The inclusion of Bank of the West contributed $461 million to non-interest revenue. The impact of the stronger U.S. dollar increased non-interest revenue by 1% on both a reported and an adjusted basis.
Reported non-interest revenue, net of CCPB, decreased primarily due to the loss related to fair value management actions in the current year, compared with a gain in the prior year. Adjusted non-interest revenue, net of CCPB, increased due to the inclusion of Bank of the West and AIR MILES, higher trading and card-related revenue and the impact of the stronger U.S. dollar, partially offset by lower underwriting and advisory revenue and securities gains, other than trading. Trading-related revenue is discussed in the section that follows.
Gross insurance revenue was $2,498 million, compared with a loss of $157 million in the prior year, primarily due to changes in the fair value of investments and higher annuity sales. Insurance revenue can experience variability arising from fluctuations in the fair value of insurance assets caused by movements in interest rates and equity markets. The investments that support policy benefit liabilities are predominantly fixed income and equity assets recorded at fair value, with changes in fair value recorded in insurance revenue in the Consolidated Statement of Income. The impact of these fair value changes was largely offset by changes in the fair value of policy benefit liabilities, which are reflected in the Insurance Claims, Commissions and Changes in Policy Benefits section.
We believe analyzing revenue, net of CCPB, is useful given the extent to which insurance revenue can vary, and given that this variability is largely offset in CCPB.
