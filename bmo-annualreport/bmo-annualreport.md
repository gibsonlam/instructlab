BMO's 2023 Financial Performance
Medium-term objectives 2023 financial performance
EPS growth of 7% to 10% (71.6)%
ROE of 15% or more 6.0%
ROTCE of 18% or more 8.2%
Net operating leverage of 2% or more (45.9)%
Capital ratios that exceed regulatory requirements 12.5% CET1 Ratio

Earnings per Share Growth 
All references to earnings per share (EPS) are to diluted EPS, unless otherwise indicated. 
EPS was $5.68 in 2023, a decrease of $14.31 or 72% from $19.99 in 2022. Adjusted EPS was $11.73, a decrease of $1.50 or 11% from $13.23 in 2022. The decrease in EPS reflected lower earnings and a higher number of common shares outstanding. Net income available to common shareholders decreased 70% year-over-year on a reported basis, and decreased 5% on an adjusted basis. The average number of diluted common shares outstanding increased 7% from 2022, reflecting common shares issued during the year through a public offering, private placements, the dividend reinvestment plan, acquisitions and the stock option plan.

Return on Equity and Return on Tangible Common Equity 
Reported return on equity (ROE) was 6.0% in 2023 and adjusted ROE was 12.3%, compared with 22.9% and 15.2%, respectively, in 2022. Reported ROE decreased due to lower net income, primarily due to lower revenue in the current year resulting from the impact of fair value management actions related to the acquisition of Bank of the West, and higher expenses in the current year due to higher acquisition and integration-related costs. Reported and adjusted ROE decreased due to the impact of share issuances, as well as lower earnings.
There was a decrease of $9,272 million in reported net income available to common shareholders and a decrease of $476 million in adjusted net income available to common shareholders in the current year. Average common shareholders’ equity increased $9.4 billion or 16% from 2022, primarily due to the issuance of common shares and growth in retained earnings, partially offset by a decrease in accumulated other comprehensive income.
Reported return on tangible common equity (ROTCE) was 8.2%, compared with 25.1% in 2022, and adjusted ROTCE was 15.8%, compared with 16.6% in 2022. Reported and adjusted ROTCE decreased due to lower earnings, partially offset by lower tangible common equity. Book value per share increased 2% from the prior year to $97.17, reflecting the increase in shareholders’ equity.

Efficiency Ratio and Operating Leverage 
BMO’s reported gross efficiency ratio was 68.0% in 2023, compared with 48.0% in 2022. On a net revenue basis (1), the reported efficiency ratio was 72.5%, compared with 47.1% in 2022, and the adjusted efficiency ratio was 59.8%, compared with 55.8% in 2022. The increase in the efficiency ratio reflected revenue growth that was more than offset by higher expense growth, as well as the impact of Bank of the West, which operated at a higher efficiency ratio.
Reported operating leverage was negative 38.5%. On a net revenue basis, reported operating leverage was negative 45.9%, and adjusted operating leverage was negative 8.2%.

Common Equity Tier 1 Ratio 
Our Common Equity Tier 1 (CET1) Ratio was 12.5% as at October 31, 2023, compared with 16.7% as at October 31, 2022. Our CET1 Ratio was elevated at the end of fiscal 2022, primarily driven by fair value management actions related to the acquisition of Bank of the West. The CET1 Ratio decreased from the prior year, primarily as a result of the acquisition and integration of Bank of the West.

Total Shareholder Return for the year ended October 31 2023 
Closing market price per common share ($) 104.79 
Dividends paid ($ per share) 5.72 
Dividend yield (%) 5.5 
Increase (decrease) in share price (%) (16.5) 
Total annual shareholder return (%) (12.5) 
Canadian peer group average (excluding BMO) (8.8)

The average annual total shareholder return (TSR) is a key measure of shareholder value, and over time, we expect that execution on our strategic priorities will drive value creation for our shareholders. The one-year, three-year and five-year average annual TSR was negative 12.5%, positive 14.3% and positive 5.6%, respectively, compared with our Canadian peer group average (excluding BMO) of negative 8.8%, positive 10.0% and positive 5.5%, respectively.
The table above summarizes dividends paid on BMO’s common shares over the past five years and the movements in our share price. An investment of $1,000 in BMO common shares made at the beginning of fiscal 2019 would have been worth $1,315 as at October 31, 2023, assuming reinvestment of dividends, for a total return of 31.5%.
Dividends declared per common share in fiscal 2023 totalled $5.80, an increase of $0.36 from $5.44 in the prior year. Dividends paid over a five-year period have increased at an average annual compound rate of approximately 9%.

BMO's Recent Acquisitions
On February 1, 2023, BMO completed their acquisition of Bank of the West, including its subsidiaries, from BNP Paribas. On closing, we recognized purchase accounting fair value marks on Bank of the West’s loans and deposits of $3.0 billion and discounts on securities of $3.5 billion on our balance sheet, in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS). As previously disclosed, to manage the exposure of our regulatory capital to the risk of changes in the fair value of the assets and liabilities of Bank of the West due to changes in interest rates between the announcement and closing of the acquisition, we entered into interest rate swaps that resulted in cumulative mark-to-market gains of $5.7 billion on closing. Any exposure to interest rate risk in relation to these interest rate swaps was largely offset by our purchase of a portfolio of matched-duration U.S. treasuries and other balance sheet instruments. On closing, the swaps were neutralized and replaced with fair value accounting hedges, which in effect crystallized the unrealized loss position on our balance sheet. Accretion of the fair value marks and the discount on securities will increase net interest income, and the amortization of the fair value hedge will decrease net interest income over the remaining term of these instruments, both of which will be recorded in Corporate Services.
On June 1, 2023, we completed the acquisition of the AIR MILES Reward Program (AIR MILES) business of LoyaltyOne Co. The AIR MILES business operates as a wholly-owned subsidiary of BMO. The acquisition was accounted for as a business combination and the acquired business and corresponding goodwill are included in our Canadian P&C reporting segment

BMO's 2023 Financial Performance Review
This section provides a review of BMO’s enterprise financial performance for 2023 that ocuses on the Consolidated Statement of Income in BMO’s audited annual consolidated financial statements. A review of the operating groups’ strategies and performance follows the enterprise review.
We use a number of financial measures to assess our performance, as well as the performance of our operating segments, including amounts, measures and ratios that are presented on a non-GAAP basis. We believe that these non-GAAP amounts, measures and ratios, read together with our GAAP results, provide readers with a better understanding of how management assesses results.
Non-GAAP amounts, measures and ratios do not have standardized meanings under GAAP. They are unlikely to be comparable to similar measures presented by other companies and should not be viewed in isolation from, or as a substitute for, GAAP results.
Further discussion of non-GAAP amounts, measures and ratios is provided in the Non-GAAP and Other Financial Measures section.
For further information regarding the composition of non-GAAP and other financial measures, including supplementary financial measures, refer to the Glossary of Financial Terms.

The table above indicates the relevant average Canadian/U.S. dollar exchange rates and the impact of changes in those rates on BMO’s U.S. segment reported and adjusted results.
The Canadian dollar equivalents of BMO’s U.S. segment results that are denominated in U.S. dollars increased in 2023 relative to 2022, due to changes in the Canadian/U.S. dollar exchange rate. References in this document to the impact of the U.S. dollar do not include U.S. dollar-denominated amounts recorded outside of BMO’s U.S. segment.
Economically, our U.S. dollar income stream was not hedged against the risk of changes in foreign exchange rates during 2023 and 2022. Changes in exchange rates will affect future results measured in Canadian dollars, and the impact on those results is a function of the periods in which revenue, expenses and provisions for (or recoveries of) credit losses and income taxes arise.
Refer to the Enterprise-Wide Capital Management section for a discussion of the impact that changes in foreign exchange rates can have on BMO’s capital position

Net Income 
Reported net income was $4,377 million, compared with $13,537 million in the prior year, and adjusted net income was $8,675 million, a decrease of $364 million or 4%. The inclusion of Bank of the West results in the current year decreased reported net income by $1,498 million, and increased adjusted net income by $592 million. The impact of the stronger U.S. dollar increased net income by 1% on a reported basis, and 2% on an adjusted basis.
Adjusted results in the current year and the prior year excluded the following items:
• Acquisition and integration costs of $1,533 million ($2,045 million pre-tax) in the current year and $245 million ($326 million pre-tax) in the prior year, recorded in non-interest expense. The current year included acquisition and integration costs of $1,520 million ($2,027 million pre-tax) related to Bank of the West.
• A loss of $1,461 million ($2,011 million pre-tax) in the current year related to the management of the impact of interest rate changes between the announcement and closing of the Bank of the West acquisition on its fair value and goodwill, comprising $1,628 million of mark-to-market losses on certain interest rate swaps recorded in non-interest trading revenue and $383 million of losses on a portfolio of primarily U.S. treasuries and other balance sheet instruments recorded in net interest income. The prior year included revenue of $5,667 million ($7,713 million pre-tax), comprising $7,665 million of non-interest trading revenue and $48 million of net interest income.
• Initial provision for credit losses of $517 million ($705 million pre-tax) in the current year on the purchased Bank of the West performing loan portfolio.
• Amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets of $264 million ($357 million pre-tax) in the current year and $23 million ($31 million pre-tax) in the prior year, recorded in non-interest expense. The current year included amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets of $231 million ($311 million pre-tax) related to Bank of the West.
• The impact of certain tax measures enacted by the Canadian government in the current year, including a one-time tax expense of $371 million, comprising a Canada Recovery Dividend (CRD) of $312 million and $59 million related to the pro-rated fiscal 2022 impact of a 1.5% tax rate increase, net of a deferred tax asset remeasurement, and a charge of $131 million ($160 million pre-tax) related to the amended GST/HST definition for financial services, comprising $138 million recorded in non-interest revenue and $22 million recorded in non-interest expense.
• The impact of a lawsuit associated with a predecessor bank, M&I Marshall and Ilsley Bank, of $21 million ($27 million pre-tax) in the current year, comprising interest expense of $30 million and a net non-interest expense recovery of $3 million. The prior year included $846 million ($1,142 million pre-tax), comprising interest expense of $515 million and non-interest expense of $627 million.
• The impact of divestitures of $55 million ($37 million pre-tax) in the prior year related to the sale of our EMEA business and the transfer of certain U.S. asset management clients, comprising a net loss of $21 million recorded in non-interest revenue and expenses of $16 million, including taxes of $22 million on closing of the sale.

Reported net income decreased from the prior year, primarily due to the items noted above, which in aggregate reduced net income by $4,298 million, compared with a gain of $4,498 million in the prior year. Adjusted net income decreased, as the inclusion of Bank of the West and higher underlying revenue were more than offset by higher expenses and a higher provision for credit losses. Reported and adjusted net income increased in U.S. P&C and decreased in BMO Wealth Management, Canadian P&C and BMO Capital Markets. On a reported basis, Corporate Services recorded a net loss, compared with net income in the prior year, primarily due to the items noted above. On an adjusted basis, Corporate Services recorded a higher net loss.

Revenue 
(Canadian $ in millions, on a pre-tax basis)
For the year ended October 31 2023
Net interest income 18,681
Non-interest revenue 12,518
Total revenue 31,199
Insurance claims, commissions and changes in policy benefit liabilities (CCPB) 1,939
Revenue, net of CCPB 29,260

Impact of Canadian tax measures 138 
Impact of adjusting items on revenue 2,179
Adjusted revenue 33,378
Adjusted revenue, net of CCPB 31,439

Revenue, net of CCPB, and adjusted results are on a non-GAAP basis and are discussed in the Non-GAAP and Other Financial Measures section.
Reported revenue was $31,199 million, a decrease of $2,511 million or 7% from the prior year. On a basis that nets insurance claims, commissions and changes in policy benefit liabilities (CCPB) against insurance revenue (net revenue), reported net revenue was $29,260 million, a decrease of $5,133 million or 15% from the prior year, and adjusted net revenue was $31,439 million, an increase of $4,223 million or 16%. The inclusion of Bank of the West contributed $3,143 million to both reported and adjusted revenue in the current year. The impact of the stronger U.S. dollar increased revenue by 2% on both a reported and an adjusted basis.
The decrease in reported net revenue primarily reflected the impact of fair value management actions and the impact of certain tax measures enacted by the Canadian government, partially offset by lower interest expense due to the legal provision related to the lawsuit associated with M&I Marshall and Ilsley Bank in the prior year. Net revenue increased across all operating groups and decreased in Corporate Services on both a reported and an adjusted basis.
BMO analyzes revenue at the consolidated level based on GAAP revenue as reported in the audited annual consolidated financial statements, on a basis net of insurance CCPB, and on an adjusted basis.
Further discussion is provided in the 2023 Operating Groups Performance Review section.
For further information on non-GAAP amounts, measures and ratios, and results presented on a net revenue basis in this Revenue section, refer to the Non-GAAP and Other Financial Measures section

Net Interest Income 
Reported net interest income was $18,681 million, an increase of $2,796 million or 18% from the prior year, and adjusted net interest income was $19,094 million, an increase of $2,742 million or 17%.
The increase in reported net interest income primarily reflected lower interest expense related to the lawsuit associated with M&I Marshall and Ilsley Bank in the prior year, partially offset by the impact of fair value management actions in the current year.
Adjusted net interest income increased due to the inclusion of Bank of the West, higher balances and margins in Canadian P&C and higher margins in U.S. P&C, as well as the impact of the stronger U.S. dollar, partially offset by a decrease in trading-related interest income, lower net interest income in Corporate Services and the impact of risk transfer transactions. Trading-related net interest income was $900 million, a decrease of $772 million, and was largely offset in trading non-interest revenue.
BMO’s overall reported net interest margin of 1.63% increased 1 basis point from the prior year. Adjusted net interest margin, excluding trading-related net interest income and trading-related earning assets, was 1.86%, an increase of 8 basis points, primarily due to higher margins in our P&C businesses, including the impact of Bank of the West, partially offset by higher low-yielding assets and lower net interest income in Corporate Services.

Reported non-interest revenue was $12,518 million, a decrease of $5,307 million from the prior year. Reported non-interest revenue, net of CCPB, was $10,579 million, a decrease of $7,929 million or 43% from the prior year, and adjusted non-interest revenue, net of CCPB, was $12,345 million, an increase of $1,481 million or 14%. The inclusion of Bank of the West contributed $461 million to non-interest revenue. The impact of the stronger U.S. dollar increased non-interest revenue by 1% on both a reported and an adjusted basis.
Reported non-interest revenue, net of CCPB, decreased primarily due to the loss related to fair value management actions in the current year, compared with a gain in the prior year. Adjusted non-interest revenue, net of CCPB, increased due to the inclusion of Bank of the West and AIR MILES, higher trading and card-related revenue and the impact of the stronger U.S. dollar, partially offset by lower underwriting and advisory revenue and securities gains, other than trading. Trading-related revenue is discussed in the section that follows.
Gross insurance revenue was $2,498 million, compared with a loss of $157 million in the prior year, primarily due to changes in the fair value of investments and higher annuity sales. Insurance revenue can experience variability arising from fluctuations in the fair value of insurance assets caused by movements in interest rates and equity markets. The investments that support policy benefit liabilities are predominantly fixed income and equity assets recorded at fair value, with changes in fair value recorded in insurance revenue in the Consolidated Statement of Income. The impact of these fair value changes was largely offset by changes in the fair value of policy benefit liabilities, which are reflected in the Insurance Claims, Commissions and Changes in Policy Benefits section.
